# Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Experience
This is the work that I have done through a Data Analytics and Visualization virtual Internship at Accenture USA.

This repository contains the file of cleaning and modelling data in the jupyter notebook
+ power bi file that contains simple visualizations to understand data and a presentation of general insights from data.
